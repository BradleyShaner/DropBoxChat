# DropBoxChat
Simple DropBox chatroom using a text file. Learning exercise :)

Maybe some day I'll add more stuff -- like encrypting/decrypting each message for each user to protect from impersonation, or a more complex message structure with multiple rooms, etc.

I'd like to learn more about threading, so if someone reading this can think of a better way to accomplish this, please let me know!
